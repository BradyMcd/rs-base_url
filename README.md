# BaseUrl

base_url is a thin wrapper around [rust-url](https://github.com/servo/rust-url), which itself
implements the [URL Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/). The goal of base_url is to implement
a strict subset of that standard to remove redundant error checks related to the base-suitability of a
given URL.

## What is a BaseUrl

A BaseUrl can be converted from any Url which can refer to a remote resource. In practical terms, if 
you found it on the Internet it will probably work and if you're referring to a resource 'somewhere 
else' it will probably work, mailto: being a notable exception. 

Internally any Url which returns false on a ```.cannot_be_a_base()``` call and true on a 
```.has_authority()``` call will convert. That means setting things like credentials and port numbers
cannot fail and likewise setting the path relative to the host cannot fail.

## Acquiring a BaseUrl object

A BaseUrl object may be acquired by either converting a Url or &str using TryFrom, in Stable this is
accomplished by depending on [try_from](https://crates.io/crates/try_from). If a &str cannot be parsed
into a Url object a BaseUrlError::ParseError will be returned which wraps the underlying ParseError 
type implemented by rust-url.

```
use base_url::{ BaseUrl, BaseUrlError, Url, ParseError, TryFrom };

assert!( BaseUrl::try_from( "http://[:::1]" ) == Err( BaseUrlError::ParseError( ParseError::InvalidIpv6Address ) ) );
```

That's a bit unwieldly, so it's suggested that you prefer first parsing the &str into a Url and
converting that object into a BaseUrl, allowing you to deal with errors related to parsing separately
from errors related to base suitability.

```
use base_url::{ BaseUrl, BaseUrlError, Url, TryFrom };

# fn run( ) -> Result< (), BaseUrlError > {
let url:Url = Url::parse( "data:text/plain,Hello?World#" )?;

assert!( BaseUrl::try_from( url ) == Err( BaseUrlError::CannotBeBase ) );
# Ok( () )
# }
# run( );
```

Once we have a BaseUrl we can do (almost) anything we could with a normal Url and with fewer functions
admitting potential failures and fewer calls to ```.unwrap()```.

If you do need to use some call which can remove the host or otherwise cause the Url to lose base 
suitability the wrapped Url can be acquired using ```.from()```.

## Usage

In any Rust project managed by Cargo add the following to your Cargo.toml ```[dependencies]``` section:
```
base_url="^1.0.0"
```

If you're building in nightly Rust it's suggested you instead use the nightly branch, this will avoid
an uneeded dependency in the try_from crate as well as possible name collisions between it and the 
standard implementation.
```
base_url={ git='https://github.com/bradymcd/rs-baseurl', branch = 'nightly' }
```
